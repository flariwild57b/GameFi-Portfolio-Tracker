GameFi Portfolio Tracker
A professional dashboard for your gaming assets in blockchain games and metaverses.

Do you own dozens of gaming NFTs and tokens from various P2E projects and don't know the real value of your collection? GameFi Portfolio Tracker is a powerful open-source tool that automatically aggregates, evaluates, and analyzes all your gaming assets from the Web3 world in a single, easy-to-understand interface.

Turn the chaos of scattered inventories into a clear financial picture. Manage, don't just collect.

Key features
Automatic asset aggregation: Connect your wallet and the tracker will instantly detect and classify all your gaming NFTs (characters, land, items), gaming currency tokens, and liquidity in gaming pools. Support for dozens of popular blockchain games (Axie Infinity, The Sandbox, Decentraland, Star Atlas, and more).

Unified real-time portfolio valuation: Get the total value of your gaming portfolio in US dollars (USD) or ETH. The value of each asset is updated based on real-time data from NFT marketplaces and DEX.

In-depth analysis and metrics:

Distribution by game and asset type: See at a glance which projects your capital is concentrated in.

Price dynamics (PnL): Track profits and losses for each asset and for your portfolio as a whole since it was added.

Liquidity and volatility: Assess how quickly assets can be sold and how much their price fluctuates.

Yield & Rewards Monitoring: Automatically track your unclaimed rewards (staking rewards, game tokens) in supported games and related DeFi protocols. Never miss a thing.

Smart Notifications: Set up alerts for significant asset price changes, liquidity drops, or new income opportunities in your games.

Secure Read-Only Mode: All data is obtained through public blockchain and marketplace APIs. Your assets are completely safe.

Who is this tracker for?
Investors in GameFi and metaverses who manage a portfolio of gaming assets as a financial instrument.

Active players (P2E gamers) who need to track the effectiveness of their investments in game accounts and equipment.

Guilds and esports organizations that need transparent accounting of assets distributed among hundreds of participants.

Content creators and analysts who review the gaming economy and need accurate data.

Important warning and ethical principles
GameFi Portfolio Tracker is a tool for analytics and financial accounting, not for gameplay.

It is NOT a cheat, bot, or game client modification. The program does not interact with game clients, automate actions, or provide unfair advantages.

It operates in read-only mode. The tracker cannot make transactions, sell your assets, or perform game actions. It only analyzes public data.

This is not financial advice. Asset valuation is for informational purposes only. The NFT and gaming token markets are extremely volatile.

You are responsible for the security of your wallet. Only use the tool with public addresses or wallets intended for analysis.

Technology
The project is built on a modern stack [e.g., TypeScript/React + Node.js + PostgreSQL] and integrates with leading providers:

Blockchain data: The Graph, Moralis, Covalent, Tatum API.

NFT data: OpenSea API, Rarible API, LooksRare API.

Price feeds: CoinGecko API, Binance API.

The architecture allows for easy expansion to support new games and blockchains.

Why will GameFi Portfolio Tracker become your primary tool?
All information in one place: Forget about dozens of tabs and spreadsheets.

Professional analytics: Make decisions about buying, selling, or playing based on accurate data, not rumors.

Time savings: Automating manual data collection saves hours every day.

Asset control: Always know what's happening with your GameFi investments.

Open source and security: Complete transparency of the logic and no access to private keys.

GameFi is a serious investment. Manage it like a pro.
